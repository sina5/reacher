# Reacher
Reacher Unity Environment

In this project, I used DDPG model to train 20 agents to reach and follow a balloon around. This environment has 33 states per agent. And each agent has 4 continuous actions or degrees of freedom. The environment is episodic, and to solve it, the agents must attain a average score of +30 over 100 consecutive episodes.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Install Python
I have tested this repo with Python 3.9 and 3.10. To continue, install either of these versions on your local machine. With Python installed, I suggest you create a virtual environment to install required libraries:

```bash
python -m venv desired_path_for_env
```
Activate this environment before moving to next step. For addirional help, [check Python documentation here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

### Install PIP Packages

The required packages for this project are listed in [requirements file](requirements.txt). To install these libraries, from the repo folder, run the following command in your virtual env:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Download Unity Reacher
The already built Unity environment for this project is accessible from following links:

Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher.app.zip)
Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Windows_x86.zip)
Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Windows_x86_64.zip)


Decompress (unzip) the downloaded file and copy it to the repo folder.

## Running the scripts

The training and testing scripts are located in [scripts](scripts) folder.

### Training

To train the model, use [train_agent.py](scripts/train_agent.py) script. This script accepts the following arguments:

- Path to downloaded Unity App: --unity-app
- Target Score to save trained model: --target-score

```bash
cd scripts
python train_agent.py --unity-app Reacher.app --target-score 30
```


On my machine, the environment was solved in 101 episodes:

```
Episode 95	Average Score: 29.26
Episode 96	Average Score: 29.35
Episode 97	Average Score: 29.43
Episode 98	Average Score: 29.52
Episode 99	Average Score: 29.61
Episode 100	Average Score: 29.69
Episode 101	Average Score: 30.08

Environment solved in 101 episodes!	Average Score: 30.08
Trained model weights saved to: checkpoint_101.pth
```

### Testing

To compare a trained agent with a untrained one, use [test_agent.py] script. This script accepts the following arguments: 

- Path to downloaded Unity App: --unity-app
- Path to saved actor model checkpoint: --actor-checkpoint-file
- Path to saved critic model checkpoint: --critic-checkpoint-file

```bash
cd scripts
python test_agent.py --unity-app Reacher.app --actor-checkpoint-file ../checkpoints/actor_checkpoint_101.pth --critic-checkpoint-file ../checkpoints/critic_checkpoint_101.pth
```
